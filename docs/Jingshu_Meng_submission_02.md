I contributed to this project by implementing the base template that has a navigation bar to redirect to other pages including the map page, index page, request page and library page.

In addition, I extended map.html from the base template.

Lastly, I gave the video presentation. I made the slides and did the recording and video editing. My teammates helped with proofreading and gave valuable advices.
