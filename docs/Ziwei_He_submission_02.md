I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I turned the map html into view and template. Also, I modified the url mappings and data models to enrich the data that the users might have

In addition, I designed and implemented the view code for the map UI as well as providing the URL design and mapping.

Lastly, I helped with the video and I helped other teammates to resolve some of the technical difficulties.
