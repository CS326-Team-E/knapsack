# Innovative Idea

knapsack is an innovative platform designed to empower your campus experience by giving you access to several useful tools, such as a campus schedule visualizer, a meal planner, and a study planner. The modular design enables content creators to realize their own ideas and contribute to a powerful ecosystem of applications. A voting system will measure the demand for certain utilities. Users will be able to manage their own knapsack, choosing the perfect combination of applications that meet their needs. 

The applications that make up knapsack aren’t individually original, neither is the concept of collecting components in a single platform (see every app store ever). However, we are specifically targeting the college student audience and our voting system and modular design have never been accomplished in a single web app to our knowledge.

# User Interface

Our user interface consists of a welcome page with an explanation of knapsack with accompanying images and a signup form. Throughout the platform, there will be a floating knapsack icon that expands into a navigation bar for access to the component applications. In addition, there will be a library in which the user browses for tools and assembles their knapsack. We will mock out an individual component application as well. Lastly, there will be an interface for requesting and voting for component ideas.
