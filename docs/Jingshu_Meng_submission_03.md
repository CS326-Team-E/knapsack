I contributed to this project by mostly making minor adjustments. For example, the previous submission had inconsistent font styles and sizes due to incorrectly extending the html pages from the base template. I corrected that. Also I changed things like which page links to what other pages, etc.
In addition, I'm trying to make a new html page that makes new tools that will probably be finished by the end of 48 hour extension.

Lastly, I helped with editing in the group writeup.
