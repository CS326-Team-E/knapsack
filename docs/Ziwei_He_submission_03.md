I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically,
1. For all other components, I created an one-to-one mapping from the built-in user to the user model we created. I also tweaked the user to sync the changes happened in the mirrored user. I also added the built-in django group for users for easier management.

2. In addition, I largely focused on the functionalities of Map view which is our home view. I designed and implemented the view code for the map UI. For the use of map view, I modified the data model and extended the fields in Tools. Now we can render the tool's location and also display the tool's main interface in our main view.
There are several components in map view that I changed in Project 3. I refined the look and layout of the main components to match the look of the other pages. I added the inline webpage to display each highly customizable tools in a modal window for easy access of the user. If the user want to add another tool, one will be redirected to the library to find the tool that fits his/her needs. The mapview will display all tools in his/her knapsack when one id logged in.
Developers can now have the possibility to upload customized tools to our system (using html, css, js etc.)

Lastly, I also helped with the video and I helped other teammates to resolve some of the technical difficulties.
